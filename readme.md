# isStrHex
Simple way to detect if a string is a hexadecimal value (`A-Fa-f0-9`)
This is a very simple code, that would help with validation of strings, And is used inside another of my packages. Main reason of the creation for me was to validate data input on Ethereum transactions in case the user added a non-hex character inside any of the values. but can be used for pretty much anything else (as long as a simple hex validation is needed)
